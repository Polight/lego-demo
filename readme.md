# Lego Web-Components Demo

This is a demo of [Lego](https://lego.js.org).

Lego is a minimalistic web-component library to build custom native HTML elements.
It is lightweight, fast and future-proof.

[Read the documentation](https://lego.js.org).

[Access the source code](https://github.com/polight/lego).


The demo was generated running the following command:

```
npm install
npm run build-demo
```

Then start a local server (ex: `python3 -m http.server 8080`) and open your browser
at http://localhost:8080.

The index.css file is used for the demo interface and for some components.
