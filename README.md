# Lego Web Components Demo

This place is a good start to experiment the [Lego Webcomponents Library](https://github.com/Polight/lego).

[Lego](https://lego.js.org) is a minimalistic web-component library to write HTML/CSS/JS in a modern, native and powerful new way.

## Usage of this demo

[Lego](https://lego.js.org/getting-started/) is simple to install:

```
npm install @polight/lego
```

or

```
yarn add @polight/lego
```

Will transpile HTML components in _bricks/_ to JS components into _dist/_.
